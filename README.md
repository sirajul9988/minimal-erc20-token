# Minimal ERC-20 Token

A clean and efficient implementation of the ERC-20 token standard. This repository is ideal for developers looking to understand the core mechanics of fungible tokens on Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

### Features
* **Standard Compliant:** Fully compatible with the ERC-20 interface (Total Supply, BalanceOf, Transfer, TransferFrom, Approve, Allowance).
* **Gas Optimized:** Written with efficiency in mind to reduce deployment and transaction costs.
* **Events:** Includes standard `Transfer` and `Approval` events for easy indexing by frontend applications.

### Setup
1. Open `Token.sol` in your preferred development environment (like Remix or Hardhat).
2. Set your desired token `name`, `symbol`, and `decimals` in the constructor.
3. Deploy to your network of choice.
